### Repositories
##### Origin (Bitbucket)

This is our main repository, here is the code that will be in our production server. It will contain two branches, **Integration** branch that contain the new code that will be tested and then move to the **Master** branch that contains the code that will be in our production server.

#### Fork (Bitbucket)

This is a copy of the **Origin** repository, here you will push your story branches from your local repository and then you will create the pull request from your story branches against the integration branch in the Origin repository

#### Your Repo (Local Machine)

Here you will be working in your code, you can do whatever you want, just remember create an independent branch for each user story that you work, then when you finish your work push the branch to your fork repository so you can create the pull request against the integration branch


## How to setup the development enviroment

This project run in **(ubuntu 16.04)**

**Clone the origin repo**

You can clone the repo Using SSH
(you need to configure the ssh key in bitbucket)

`git clone git@bitbucket.org:nezara/skywalker.git`

**Add a remote for your fork repo**

This is the content of each file:

**base.py**: contain the base settings that are shared in the development and the production enviroments

**dev.py**: contain the specific settings for the development enviroment

**prod.py**: contain the specific settings for the production enviroment


### Execute the project

Create the migrations files

`python manage.py makemigration --settings=skywalker.settings.dev`

Create the tables

`python manage.py migrate_schemas --shared --settings=skywalker.settings.dev`

create-tenants.py will create some example tenants (public and a tenant named 'tenant')

`python manage.py shell < ../utilities/create-tenants.py --settings=skywalker.settings.dev`

run the development server

`python manage.py runserver --settings=skywalker.settings.dev`
